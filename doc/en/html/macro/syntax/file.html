<h1>Encoding</h1>

<p>
The Unicode(UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE) can be supported from Tera Term 4.102.

<p>
The TTL file was processed as ANSI CodePage in previous version.

<h2>Encoding determination</h2>

Tera Term determines the encoding as follows.

<ul>
  <li>When BOM exists<br>
	Tera Term determines one of UTF-8, UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE from BOM type, next reading the file.</li>
  <li>When BOM does not exist</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Reading the file as UTF-8.</li>
	  <li>Reading the file as CP_ACP(same as before 4.102) when the file can not be decoded.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
